summary : Compute MD5 hash for store-managed disks

description: Digest queries the identified store to see if any \
 acquired disk content has an associated digest file.  For all those \
 that do not, it computes a digest of that disk by MD5 hashing each \
 64K grain and storing the result into a digest file alongside the \
 original data.  Alternatively, a single acquired disk identified by \
 index-in-store can be digested.


example.1: push D S
example.2: digest S
example.3: digest S 2
