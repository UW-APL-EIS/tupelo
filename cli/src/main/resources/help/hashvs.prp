summary : Hash unallocated areas of a store-managed disk

description : The hashvs command uses Sleuthkit (think mmls) to identify any \
unallocated areas of the specified store-managed disk.  Unallocated \
areas are sector sequences not contained in any partition/filesystem. \
For each sequence, an MD5 hash is computed over all sectors in the \
sequence, and the results stored alongside the disk data (the .tmd \
file).

example.1 : hashvs S 1
example.2 : hashvs -p S 2
