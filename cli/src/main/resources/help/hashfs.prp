summary : Hash file systems of a store-managed disk

description : The hashfs command uses Sleuthkit (think fls) to first \
locate all filesystems of the specified store-managed disk.  It then \
finds all allocated files in all those filesystems, and computes the \
MD5 hash over the file content for each file.  The results are then \
stored alongside the disk data (the .tmd file).  The results are \
pairs (MD5,fileName).

example.1 : hashfs S 1
example.2 : hashvs -p S 2
