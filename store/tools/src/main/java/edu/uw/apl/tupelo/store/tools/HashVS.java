/**
 * Simple Tupelo Utility: Walk some previously added ManagedDisk,
 * using tsk4j/Sleuthkit routines and a FUSE filesystem to access the
 * managed data.  The 'walk' visits every UNALLOCATED partition in the
 * VolumeSystem and produces a sha1 hash of its content.  We visit
 * only unallocated parts of the disk since we need much finer grained
 * inspection of filesystems.  Different results for a hash at time
 * T1, T2 over a partition containing a filesystem would not tell you
 * WHICH file(s) changed, so see e.g. {@link HashFS} for that.
 *
 * If the -a option is supplied, we store the result (a multi-line
 * formatted string) back to the Tupelo store as an attribute of the
 * managed disk.
 *
 * Note: This program makes use of fuse4j/fuse and so has an impact on
 * the host filesystem as a whole.  In principle, a fuse mount point
 * is created at program start and deleted at program end.  However,
 * if user exits early (Ctrl C), we may have a lasting mount point.
 * To delete this, do
 *
 * $ fusermount -u test-mount
 *
 * We do have a shutdown hook for the umount installed, but it appears
 * unreliable.
