\begin{frame}{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Tupelo is a set of Java/C programs for efficient whole disk
  acquisition, storage and analysis.

\item Leverages existing open-source forensics library called
  Sleuthkit to walk filesystems.

\item Integrates with emerging standard STIX (Structured
  Threat Information Expression) to ingest and
  author shared information of malicious artifacts.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Goals}

To minimize the time, effort and expense of maintaining the health of
computer hard drives.  To achieve this

\begin{itemize}

\item Whole drive acquisition must be easy and (relatively!) fast.

\item Repeated acquisition must be space-efficient.

\item Analysis of disk contents must be automated to the greatest
  extent possible.

\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Problem of Trust}

If the drive you wish to acquire (image) is suspected of containing
malicious artifacts, how can software residing on that same disk
be relied upon to present accurate disk content?

Tupelo does ``dead disk acquisition'', and runs of trusted media,
e.g. a bootable CD/USB.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Tupelo Workflows and the Store}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Users acquire whole drive contents, storing a copy in a {\em Tupelo
  store}.

\item
Once in the store, contents are analysed: filesystems, un-allocated
areas.

\item
Analysis results also placed in the store alongside the content as {\em
  attributes}, key/value pairs with arbitrary values.

\item
Same disk can be acquired repeatedly, and many disks can be acquired.

\end{itemize}

Store is essentially a structured (but not relational) database.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Supported Disk Types}

Can acquire three flavors of whole disk content:

\begin{description}
\item[Physical]  An entire hard drive.  To ensure ``dead'', boot from
  Tupelo CD.

\item[Virtual] A hard drive of a virtual machine.  To ensure ``dead'',
  acquire with VM powered off.  VirtualBox and VMWare disks supported.

\item[Disk Image] A previously obtained whole disk image, as a file.
  Dead by definition.
\end{description}

Could also boot virtual machines from virtualized Tupelo CD, treats
virtual disks as physical.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Use Cases}

Tupelo supports several modes of use.


\begin{itemize}
\item 
Single User

\item
Single Administrator

\item
Administrator Group

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
End user scenario.  One hard drive to acquire, store on
  external disk (USB/eSATA), boot from Tupelo CD.  Acquire on a
  schedule, e.g. once a week.  
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
Single administrator scenario.  Many drives to acquire, also on a
  schedule.  Reference images (e.g. vanilla Win7 install) added to
  store reduces time spent classifying artifacts.
\end{frame}
