/**
   A ManagedDiskDescriptor (bad name but what is better?) is essentially a pair:

   1 volume id - a string

   2 session id

   so captures 'what' and 'when'

   
   When embedded in a filesystem directory within e.g. a
   FilesystemStore, an MDM becomes

   /path/to/store/.../VID/SESSIONID/...

   and subdirs like 'data' and 'attrs' then follow.

   Similarly, when embedded in a http url or amqp message, an MDM becomes

   ../VID/SESSIONID/...

   The ordering of the two members in the formatted descriptors
   follows that of increasing entropy: vol id very stable (should
   never change!), session id more dynamic (since disk contents are a
   function of time)
