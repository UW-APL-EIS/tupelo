/**

 *
 * A test/fake implementation of an UnmanagedDisk.  This one is an
 * in-memory disk (needs no real backing disk) which produces random
 * data when read.  The 'random' nature does NOT give a new random
 * buffer for each read, it just re-uses the same buffer.  The only
 * way the local buffer is filled with fresh 'random' data is when a
 * larger buffer is needed, due to a larger length being read than we
 * had previously seen.
 *
 * So as long as all reads for data are the same, say 1MB, the same
 * 1MB of data will be returned each time.  But, LOOK, the disk
 * contents should not really be a function of how that content is
 * read, which it is here.
 *
 * The random stream produced is seeded by the Disk size, so
 * RandomDisks of same size produce identical content.  Such disks
 * cannot 'change content' over time.
