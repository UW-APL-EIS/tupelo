 * A test/fake implementation of an UnmanagedDisk.  This one is an
 * in-memory disk (needs no real backing disk) which produces random
 * data when read.  The 'random' nature does NOT give a new random
 * buffer for each read, it just re-uses the same buffer of say 16MB
 * over and over.  The 'randomness' of the data is then confined to that
 * one local buffer, which is 're-sampled' over and over.
 *
 * By default, the random stream produced is seeded by the Disk size, so
 * RandomDisks of same size produce identical content.  Such disks
 * cannot 'change content' over time.  Can also supply a seed.
 *
 * Uses commons.io's NullInputStream, a nice class which already takes
 * care of the moving 'position' (file pointer) in the data as the
 * user calls read (and perhaps skip)
