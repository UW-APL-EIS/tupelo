/**
 * Used for monitoring how ManagedDisk 'transfer' operations are
 * proceeding.  By transfer we mean the act of transferring unmanaged
 * data (a DiskImage, PhysicalDisk, VirtualDisk) to managed data,
 * normally by way of a Store.put() operation.
 *
 * Monitoring the progress of this transfer gives us a way to print
 * the familiar "X % finished" to the user, keeping them informed of
 * possibly lengthy (minutes, hours??) operations.
 *
 * A nice feature of this design is that the ManagedDisk
 * implementations do not have to 'participate' in the byte counting
 * involved in the transfer monitoring process.  Given how complex
 * e.g. {@link StreamOptimizedDisk} 'transfers' (unmananged to
 * managed) are, this is a VERY good thing.  All that ManagedDisk
 * implementations have to do is implement {@link #readFromWriteTo},
 * and use the supplied InputStream to read unmanaaged data from, and
 * not their own unmanagedData.getInputStream().
