 * A fake 'disk' in which contents come from a byte[].  We maintain
 * the byte[] by reference, enabling the user to mutate the data, just
 * like a real disk contents would mutate over time.  Like all MemoryDisks,
 * has no actual I/O operations at all.
 *
 * Useful in testing Tupelo store puts, especially with parent links
 * and the use of parent digests.  We build a single ByteArrayDisk,
 * but mutate its content between Store.put operations:
 *
 * byte[] contents = new byte[N];
 * ByteArrayDisk bad = new ByteArrayDisk( contents );
 * ... store operations ...
 *
 * Mutate the unmanaged 'disk';
 * contents[X] = 18; contents[Y] = 21; ....
 *
 * ... more store operations ...
 *
