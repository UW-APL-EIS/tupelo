 * PhysicalDisk relies on DeviceFile for its low-level info access,
 * i.e disk serial number, size, etc.  Here we are testing how
 * PhysicalDisk can be used when the native load of DeviceFile fails,
 * normally due to the code being run on a platform for which
 * DeviceFile native was never built.
 
 * This test MUST be run on its own, via e.g.
 *
 * mvn test -Dtest=DeviceFileLoadFailTest
 *
 * and NOT with other tests.  All tests are apparently done in a
 * single VM, and by a single class loader (??).  So if a test run
 * before this one successfully loads the Device File native library,
 * we cannot later force a deliberate load failure.
