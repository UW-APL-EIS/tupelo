/**
 * I have always wanted to do this.  Affect the log level of the
 * loggers used BY the web app by way of a url request sent TO the
 * webapp.  'Edit the log4j.properties file and reload the war' - just
 * say no!
 *
 * Likely used in the scenario 'The web site is not working.  Do a
 * wget/curl to change the log level and monitor the amqp message bus
 * (since we have a rabbitmq appender configured)'. Note that we
 * respond to POST, not GET.
 *
 * One gotcha: Apache commons logging, though a nice facade for log4j,
 * provides no way to set a log level.  So here, and here only, we use
 * log4j classes directly, pah! Elsewhere in this web app, we use
 * commons logging (why?!)
 *
 * The expected url layout (i.e. path entered into web.xml) for this
 * servlet is
 *
 * /logging/debug
 * /logging/info, etc
