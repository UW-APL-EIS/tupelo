/**
   A ManagedDisk as can be re-constituted by a servlet from components
   passed in e.g. an http request pathInfo (for diskId and sessionID)
   and inputStream (for the content).  Effectively an unmarshalling
   operation.  A nice fallout of this way of 'uploading' a ManagedDisk
   over http is that there is no requirement that the client is Java.

   This odd class is needed by the {@link DataServlet} since it has to
   pass ManagedDisk objects to/from the Store.  The Store of course
   has no idea that http is involved at all.

   Once into the store, the HttpManagedDisk will have its
   setManagedData() call applied, just like any managedDisk does.
   Unlike other managedDisk types though, this causes the
   HttpManagedDisk to create its 'delegate' ManagedDisk object. All
   subsequent store-derived calls into an HttpManagedDisk are then
   forwarded to the delegate. The nice thing about this design is that
   the store need never know it is dealing with http-uploaded data.
   The alternative to this 'delegate tracking' would be for all
   ManagedDisk types to provide a 'morph into' api, this is better.
   Of course when the store is restarted, those objects that were
   HttpManagedDisks at time of previous upload would now be loaded
   from store disk as e.g. StreamOptimizedDisks.  Thus
   HttpManagedDisks are only needed as objects in the time interval
   between their creation and the next store restart.
